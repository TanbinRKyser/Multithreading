# Multithreading

A collection of examples and experiments demonstrating **multithreading concepts** in programming. This repository is intended as a learning resource to understand how concurrent programming works, how to manage threads, and how to avoid common pitfalls like race conditions and deadlocks.

---

## ✨ Features

- Multiple **threading examples** using different synchronization mechanisms
- Demonstrates:
  - Thread creation and management
  - Shared resource handling
  - Synchronization primitives (locks, mutexes, semaphores)
  - Deadlock scenarios and solutions
  - Thread-safe data structures
- Clear, minimal examples for learning purposes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C/C++ or Java compiler (depending on language used)
- (Optional) IDE or build tool like **CMake**, **Gradle**, or **Maven**

### Build and Run
```bash
# Example (if using g++ and C++):
g++ -pthread src/basic_threads/example.cpp -o example
./example

# Or if using Java:
javac src/basic_threads/Example.java
java Example
